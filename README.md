# surroVision3D - CCS Reservoir Modeling with Deep Learning

This repository contains implementations and experiments of several deep learning models for predicting **Pressure Buildup (PBU)** and **Gas Saturation** in carbon capture and storage (CCS) reservoir simulations. The models were evaluated on various 2D/3D datasets with differing spatial and temporal resolutions.

## Notebooks Available

- `UFNO.ipynb` â€“ U-FNO model using Fourier Neural Operators.
- `Vanilla_UNet.ipynb` â€“ Experiments on 1500-sample PBU dataset using U-Net and ResNet.
- `CNN.ipynb` â€“ Lightweight CNN architecture for PBU.
- `GNN.ipynb` â€“ Graph Neural Network implemented to estimate gas saturation

## Models Implemented

- **Convolutional U-Net**  
  A deep encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections for learning multiscale spatial-temporal features.

- **U-FNO (Fourier Neural Operator)**  
  Captures global spatial dependencies through spectral convolutions, especially effective for smooth geophysical fields like PBU.

- **Graph Neural Network (GNN)**  
  Leverages structured grid information and neighborhood relations, showing excellent generalization for gas saturation prediction.

- **ResNet**  
  A residual convolutional network adapted for temporal prediction with limited data.
