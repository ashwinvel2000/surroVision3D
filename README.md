# surroVision3D - CCS Reservoir Modeling with Deep Learning

This repository contains implementations and experiments of several deep learning models for predicting **Pressure Buildup (PBU)** and **Gas Saturation** in carbon capture and storage (CCS) reservoir simulations. The models were evaluated on various 2D/3D datasets with differing spatial and temporal resolutions.

## Notebooks Available

* `UFNO.ipynb` â€“ U-FNO model using Fourier Neural Operators.
* `Vanilla_UNet.ipynb` â€“ Experiments on 1500-sample PBU dataset using U-Net and ResNet.
* `CNN.ipynb` â€“ Lightweight CNN architecture for PBU.
* `GNN.ipynb` â€“ Graph Neural Network implemented to estimate gas saturation.

## Models Implemented

* **Convolutional U-Net**
  A deep encoderâ€“decoder architecture with skip connections for learning multiscale spatialâ€“temporal features.

* **U-FNO (Fourier Neural Operator)**
  Captures global spatial dependencies through spectral convolutions (FFT-based), especially effective for smooth geophysical fields like PBU.

* **Graph Neural Network (GNN)**
  Treats the reservoir as a graph of connected cells, learning from node features and neighbor relationships. Uses dynamic EdgeConv layers with residual connections for local spatial interactions.

* **ResNet**
  A residual convolutional network adapted for temporal prediction with limited data.

* **CNN**
  A lightweight convolutional network baseline for pressure buildup prediction.

## Evaluation Metrics

The models are compared using the following metrics:

* **RÂ² Score**: Coefficient of determination (goodness of fit)
* **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error
* **Size**: Model memory footprint
